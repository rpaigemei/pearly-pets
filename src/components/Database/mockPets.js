        "about": "Raisin, a 14-ish-year-old male Lab/Boxer mix, found himself in a high-kill shelter in far southwest Virginia after his owner faced financial difficulties. Heartbreakingly, the family he knew his entire life decided they couldn't provide for him anymore. In spite of his age, Raisin's spirit remained unbroken, and his zest for life is truly remarkable.\nIn the shelter, poor Raisin faced an uncertain fate due to his age. He must have been devastated to find himself abandoned, wondering what went wrong. Fortunately, fate smiled upon him when a compassionate Homeward Trails volunteer stepped in and opened their heart and home to foster him. Now, Raisin is living the good life, enjoying regular meals, a soft warm indoor bed, and the love he deserves.\nAfter a stint in foster care, Raisin is ready to find his forever home where he can spend his golden years surrounded by love and comfort. In spite of his age, Raisin enjoys brisk walks, does well on a leash and has no issues with stairs. His positive attitude and love for people and other dogs make him a delightful companion.",

She's the best of both worlds. While she very much likes her walks, she'd prefer to spent her time hanging out with you as you watch your favorite TV show. As long as she's with you, she's happy.\nWhile Lyla does well with people of all ages and most other dogs, she would do best in a home without any cats.",

He gets along fine with other dogs, but his first love is people--he would like nothing better than to be your constant companion, although he is also fine being home alone part of the day, patiently waiting to celebrate your coming home.\nBram is a buoyant, bouncy, energetic personality, an ebullient, intelligent, joyous boy. He is not breed standard, is slightly larger, and is the rougher coat variety--not accepted in the show ring (we don't care :o). Bram is not a candidate for a jogging or hiking partner or a two story home with long staircases, as his legs are simply too short. Bram is house-trained, non-destructive, neutered, micro-chipped, de-wormed, all vaccinations; med records current.\nHe is only adoptable to homes in the Southern California area.",

We think he is a shih tzu- terrier mix- but we will just call him a Texas Special- the very best type of dog.\nIf you're willing to rub his belly he will roll over and make it easy for you. He LOVES belly rubs! He is all for being carried around, but he will need you to pet him and approach him gently first. Once he knows you and trusts you- he will love you with his whole heart! He loves human companionship and seeks out belly rubs, kisses and ear rubs!\nBeanie gets along well with other dogs, and especially loves the chihuahua puppies in his foster house. He also gets along with all the other small dogs.\nBeanie Weenie is 100% housebroken and has mastered the use of the doggie door, showing his independence and intelligence.\nBeanie is quiet in his crate, especially when it's equipped with a big fluffy pillow. He not only sleeps in there but also takes daily naps, indicating that it's his safe haven.\nLooking for a partner for a late night ice cream run or morning coffee? Beanie is good in the car, making him a great travel companion for adventures near and far. He will want a pup cup or ice-cream treat while you are out.\nBeanie quickly learned how to walk on a leash, showcasing his adaptability and willingness to learn new things. He will continue to need practice to keep him from reverting back to his alligator rolling on the leash days.\nDespite being nearly perfect, Beanie will need eye drops the rest of his life for dry eyes. He may have a slight aversion to getting his eyes treated, but this doesn't overshadow his many wonderful qualities.\nBeanie will bring joy, love, and companionship to his forever family. If he sounds like he belongs snuggled on the couch next to you, apply here to see if you are a match!",
